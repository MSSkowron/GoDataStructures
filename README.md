# GoDataStructesAndAlgorithms

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in the Go programming language.

## Repository Structure

The repository is thoughtfully organized into two main categories:

### Data Structures (ds)

The "ds" directories contain well-known and essential data structures, thoughtfully implemented in the Go programming language.

- [**Stack**](./ds_stack/) - A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that offers efficient push and pop operations.
- [**Queue**](./ds_queue/) - A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure that provides efficient enqueue and dequeue operations.
- [**Priority queue**](./ds_priority_queue/) - A priority-based data structure that ensures elements are dequeued based on their priority.
- [**Heap**](./ds_heap/) - A binary heap data structure, offering quick access to the minimum or maximum element.
- [**Linked list**](./ds_linked_list/) - A linear data structure consisting of nodes linked together, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.
- [**Hash table**](./ds_hash_table/) - An associative data structure that enables efficient key-value pair lookups.
- [**Binary search tree**](./ds_binary_search_tree/) - A binary tree structure that maintains its elements in a sorted order for quick search and retrieval.
- [**Graph**](./ds_graph/) - A versatile data structure used to represent connections between elements, facilitating various graph-related algorithms.
- [**Trie**](./ds_trie/) - An efficient information retrieval data structure, particularly useful for dictionary-like operations.
- [**Set**](./ds_set/) - A collection of unique elements that supports set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

### Algorithms (a)

The "a" directories contain well-known and fundamental algorithms, thoughtfully implemented in the Go programming language.

- [**Search**](./a_search/) - Contains various searching algorithms.
